# Python code quality for data science

(Because 10,000 articles on the topic isn't enough)
:::{card} Card Title

This is a small sample book to give you a feel for how book content is
structured.
It shows off a few of the major file types, as well as some sample content.
It does not go in-depth into any particular topic - check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.

Check out the content pages bundled with this sample book to see more.

## The audience that this is intended for

:::{card}

> It's welll known that data scientists love to tinker in Jupyteer notebooks and test out a lot of ideas.....
> #TO-DO: Fill out intro about my data science career but also seeing the benefits of learning better coding practices. #####
> ###################

> There are so many free resources today that are truly amazing. Start by going to YouTube where very talanted coders with a desire to share their expertise put out new content each week on what seems like all levels and topics, then after getting stuck on a project head to StackExchange and similar that all make Googling my problem go from a form of yelling to magically uncovering handfuls of examples of the same problem and how to solve it.There are ......

> So don't worry, I am not going to try to make a worse version of amazing and free content. I'm also not writing to aggregate as many buzz words as possible and basically be another Buzzfeed like summarizer of complex ideas distilled into a 5 minute fun read (Which jokes aside there seems to be enough money in that to where multiple sites go this route just for data science). What I am writing to share is a balanced path for upskilling Python concepts and general coding proficency that either directly make your work easier or increase your ability to collaborate with others with working on a common code base and/or presenting theoretical work from a practical angle to those who might not follow otherwise.
